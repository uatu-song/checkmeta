## Stamina Analysis

### Team Performance Assessment

Team Alpha maintained significantly better stamina management throughout the matches on Day 1. With an average stamina level of 55.0% compared to Team Beta's 25.0%, Team Alpha was able to avoid severe fatigue entirely, with only one character experiencing moderate fatigue effects.

Team Beta struggled with stamina management, with all characters experiencing at least moderate fatigue and one character (Diana) reaching severe fatigue levels. This disadvantage likely contributed to their overall match performance.

### Strategy Implications

1. **Trait Usage**: High-cost traits should be used more strategically by Team Beta in future matches to avoid rapid stamina depletion.

2. **Convergence Effects**: Team Beta had two convergence events that significantly drained their stamina. More careful management of convergence participation could help preserve stamina.

3. **Recovery Optimization**: Characters with high durability should be leveraged for their improved stamina recovery rates, particularly in multi-day tournaments.

### Stamina Forecast for Day 2

Given the overnight recovery formula, we estimate these approximate starting stamina levels for Day 2:

| Character | Current | Estimated Day 2 Starting Stamina |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Alice | 65.0 | 89.5 |
| Bob | 45.0 | 83.5 |
| Charlie | 35.0 | 80.5 |
| Diana | 15.0 | 74.5 |

*Note: These estimates assume 70% recovery of missing stamina overnight and no injuries or special conditions.*

## Recommendations

1. Team Beta should consider more conservative trait usage in early rounds to preserve stamina for crucial late-game situations.

2. Characters who reached Severe Fatigue (Diana) should be monitored closely on Day 2 for potential stamina management issues.

3. Team Alpha's stamina advantage should be leveraged in Day 2 to maintain pressure on opponents.

4. Consider trait loadouts that require less stamina for characters with persistent stamina issues.
