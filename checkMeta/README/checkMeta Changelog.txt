Let's implement our plan for the META Fantasy League Simulator enhancement. I'll focus on batch processing and rStats tracking first, which will give you the biggest immediate improvements.

Let's start by implementing the batch processing system in your meta_simulator.py file. Here's the implementation approach:

I've created the batch processing implementation for your META Fantasy League Simulator. This is the core enhancement that will address the rStats tracking and PGN recording issues.

Let me explain the key components of this implementation:

## Batch Processing Overview

The code creates a new `simulate_match_batched` method that replaces your current `simulate_match` method. It processes the simulation in batches of 5 moves each, with several important advantages:

1. **Incremental PGN Recording**: Records PGN data after each batch, preventing data loss
2. **Regular rStat Updates**: Updates rStats throughout the match, not just at the end
3. **Interim Reports**: Generates readable reports for each batch
4. **Pawn Tracking**: Counts pawns as civilians for stat tracking

## Key New Features

### 1. Pawn Tracking System
```python
def _initialize_pawn_tracking(self, boards):
    """Initialize pawn tracking for all boards"""
    # Tracks white and black pawns on each board
```

This allows tracking civilian casualties (LLS) and civilian rescues (LVS) based on pawn captures and promotions.

### 2. Team Loss Conditions
```python
def _check_team_loss_conditions(self, team):
    # Condition 1: Field Leader KO'd
    # Condition 2: KO count ≥ 5
    # Condition 3: Team morale ≤ 0
```

The match now ends immediately if any team meets these loss conditions.

### 3. Comprehensive rStat Reports
```python
def _generate_final_rstat_report(self, team_a, team_b, match_context):
    # Generates a detailed, well-formatted report with all rStats
    # Grouped by category: General, Operations-specific, Intelligence-specific
```

This will ensure all your canonical rStats are properly displayed in after-action reports.

## How to Use This Implementation

1. Add these methods to your `MetaLeagueSimulator` class
2. Change your code to use `simulate_match_batched` instead of `simulate_match`
3. Create the necessary directories:
   - `results/pgn/batches`
   - `results/reports/interim`

By implementing these changes, you'll have:
- Reliable PGN recording throughout matches
- Complete rStat tracking and reporting
- Pawn/civilian tracking
- Team loss conditions
- Detailed after-action reports

Would you like me to implement any other specific components next, such as trait catalog integration or enhanced PGN processing?

I'll integrate the rStat components into the meta_simulator.py file. Here's the updated version:

I've created an updated version of the `meta_simulator.py` file with the rStat components integrated. Here are the key changes I made:

1. **Added imports for the rStat components**:
   ```python
   from systems.rstat_validator import RStatValidator
   from systems.rstat_logger import RStatLogger
   from systems.rstat_manager import RStatManager
   ```

2. **Initialized the rStat components in the constructor**:
   ```python
   # Initialize rStat tracking components
   self.rstat_validator = RStatValidator()
   self.rstat_logger = RStatLogger()
   self.rstat_manager = RStatManager()
   ```

3. **Added character registration with the rStat manager**:
   ```python
   # Register all characters with the rStat manager
   for character in team_a + team_b:
       self.rstat_manager.register_unit(
           character["id"],
           character["name"],
           character.get("division", "o"),
           character.get("role", ""),
           character.get("team_id", "")
       )
   ```

4. **Enhanced convergence processing**:
   - Added outcome determination (critical success)
   - Used the rStat logger for convergence stats
   - Updated both local character rStats and the rStat manager

5. **Improved damage handling**:
   - Added source_character parameter to track who deals damage
   - Used the rStat logger for damage events
   - Added damage tracking to the rStat manager

6. **Enhanced end-of-round effects**:
   - Added healing tracking in rStats
   - Added trait activation tracking

7. **Added proper rStat recording for match results**:
   - Added rStats to character_results
   - Added proper record_match_result calls
   - Added team stat tracking

8. **Added CSV export of rStats at the end of each match**:
   ```python
   # Export rStats to CSV
   timestamp = int(time.time())
   rstats_file = self.rstat_manager.export_stats_to_csv(f"results/stats/match_{timestamp}_rstats")
   ```

9. **Updated the match result dictionary** to include rStats file path:
   ```python
   "rstats_file": rstats_file
   ```

These changes ensure that your META Fantasy League Simulator properly tracks, validates, and records character and team statistics throughout the simulation. The system will now generate comprehensive rStat CSV files for analysis after each match.

I'll continue with the data loader utility module for our enhanced META Fantasy League Simulator:

Now, let's create the match helper utilities module that will handle creating matchups:

Finally, let's create a visualization and reporting utility for the match results:
