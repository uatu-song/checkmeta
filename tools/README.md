# Metachess Zero

Welcome to **Metachess Zero**, a modular narrative-tactical simulation engine for running multi-board, character-driven, convergence-based chess encounters.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Simulates 8-board synchronous matchdays across 10 teams
- Processes real characters with trait-driven behavior
- Uses Stockfish to evaluate moves based on tactical depth
- Tracks stats (`rStats`) like assists, takedowns, synergies, mindbreaks
- Resolves matches turn-by-turn with PGN board state
- Supports narrative trait systems and convergence motifs

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… Full attribute injection from `attribute_stats_full.json`
- âœ… Role profiles influence move selection logic
- âœ… Tactical depth system modifies decision options
- âœ… Convergence system tracks tile-time overlaps
- âœ… PGN purge protocol removes completed boards
- âœ… Match logging per team and per matchup

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
metachess_zero/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                  # Simulation and trait logic
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                 # Lineup extraction and utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ data/lineups/          # JSON lineups generated from Excel
â”œâ”€â”€ results/               # Per-match outputs after simulation
â”œâ”€â”€ attribute_stats_full.json
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
```

## ðŸš€ Running a Matchday

```bash
python3 matchday_runner_full_pgntier_verbose.py
```

Runs 5 full matches using Stockfish, traits, depth, and convergence logic.

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

Each match logs a full JSON:
- Moves per turn
- PGN FEN state
- Unit rStats and depth
- Tactical motifs and convergence triggers

## ðŸ§  Contributions

This engine is modular. Traits, missions, motif maps, and narrative output are pluggable.
