# Meta Simulator Manifesto (v4.0)

## 🔥 Core Mission

> *The simulator must behave like a real-world engine, not a fragile project.*  
> *Every game, team, and system must be protected by design, not by luck.*

## 🔢 Non-Negotiable Rules

| Rule | Enforcement |
|:-----|:------------|
| 8v8 Team Lineups | Every team fields exactly 8 players. |
| No Inner Division Matches | Undercurrent plays Overlay only. Always enforced. |
| Alternate Home/Away | Swap sides every day, starting from Day 1. |
| Independent Chess Matches | Each player plays their own independent game. |
| 5 Matches per Day | Exactly 5 matches simulated daily. |
| 5 Days per Week | Monday through Friday only. |
| Calendar Anchoring | Day 1 is 4/7/25. Day 16 is 4/28/25. |
| Data Authority | All lineups, IDs, divisions loaded from `/data/` real files. |
| No Sample Data | Fail fast if real data missing. No dummy placeholders allowed. |
| Mandatory PGNs | Every chess game must output a valid PGN or simulation fails. |
| Gatekeeper Validation | System refuses to run if critical violations detected. |

## 🛡️ Protective Upgrades

| Addition | Reason |
|:---------|:-------|
| Validator Before Simulation | Early detection of missing pieces. |
| System Registry | New systems must self-register clearly. |
| Strict Naming Conventions | Class: `CamelCase`, File: `snake_case.py`, Function: `snake_case()`. |
| Formal Logging | No print spam. Structured logs only. |
| Critical Fail Early | If missing dependency detected, simulation halts immediately. |
| Dead Code Scanner | Detect unused methods and imports. |
| Auto Formatter Option | Optional `black`/`ruff` style enforcement checkpoints. |
| Clear Versioning | Major versions: `v3.4`, `v3.5`, etc. Snapshots maintained. |
| Continuous Savepoints | Full backups every 5 matchdays to `/build/snapshots/`. |
| No Wildcard Imports | (`from module import *`) forbidden. Explicit imports only. |

## 📆 Match Engine Flow

```plaintext
START
|
|-> Validate configuration integrity
|-> Load real teams from /data/
|-> Assign legal matchups (no inner-division)
|-> Assign players to their own chess boards
|-> Independently play all 16 games per match
|-> Save PGNs after every game
|-> Update match results, stats, standings
|-> Alternate home/away
|-> Save day report
|
END
```

## 🌟 Engineering Principle

> *If it can't survive 50 days of full league play without silent failure, it doesn't belong in the codebase.*

## 🔐 Final Rule

**Never trust luck. Trust structure.**  
**Never hope code behaves. Guarantee it behaves.**  
**The Simulator Must Endure.**
